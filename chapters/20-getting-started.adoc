=== Working With Binary Data

Since we'll be working with binary data we need to write some tools to easily and efficiently read binary data. This section will introduce Buffers.  We will then build off this knowledge to construct tooling to help us read and write data into Buffers.

- Binary data refresher
- Introduction Buffers
- Creating a Buffer Writer
- Creating a Buffer Reader 

== BitField

- Implementing a bitfield

== TLVs

- Introduction to TLVs
- Implement TLV reader

== Introduction to Peer Messages

- type + parsable length
- Implement message type enum
- "It's ok to odd" rule

== Init Message

- Implementing the `Features` `BitField`
- Implementing `InitMessage.fromBuffer()`
- Implementing `InitMessage.toBuffer()`
