= BufferWriter

You may have noticed when we using the Buffer's write methods that we needed to include the index. In our example, when we wrote several numbers of different byte lengths we needed to properly increment the index. Attempting to manually increment the write index may result in errors and certainly will result in more code.

In order to make serializing complex data easier we will use a BufferWriter that will manage the index for us. This class will include similar methods to Buffer for writing various number types.

- using the write method (Uint8, UInt16BE, UInt32BE, UInt64BE)

- creating a writeVarInt method
- creating a writeBigSize method
- creating a writeTUInt16 method
- creating a writeTUInt32 method
- creating a writeTUInt64 method
