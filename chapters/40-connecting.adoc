= Connecting to a Node

Goal of this chapter is to enable an outbound connection to another node from code. This will maintain the connection and using the ping/pong protocol and perform a proper handshake using the `init` message.

== Why?

- confidentiality, integrity, authenticity
- performs authentication to known node identities
- connector remains blind until connection is established
- efficient cryptographic scheme
- maintains forward secrecy
