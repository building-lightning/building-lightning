= Connecting to a Node

Goal of this chapter is to enable an outbound connection to another node from code. This will maintain the connection and using the ping/pong protocol and perform a proper handshake using the `init` message.

== Why?

- confidentiality, integrity, authenticity
- performs authentication to known node identities
- connector remains blind until connection is established
- efficient cryptographic scheme
- maintains forward secrecy

== Overview of Connecting Process

== NoiseXK

== `Peer`  creation

- contains a noise socket
- encapsulates information obtained by the peer
- captures the initialization and feature negotiation



== Implementing the Ping Pong Protocol

-
- implementing the `ping` message
- implementing the `pong` message
