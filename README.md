# Programming Lightning

A book that teaches you how to create a Bitcoin Lightning Network node from scratch...(well almost).

In order to build a node you need to understand how they are supposed to operate. Deciphering the complex Lightning Network specifications known as BOLTs is not for the faint-of-heart. This book breaks down the specifications and translates it into simple to understand programming exercises. The step-by-step guide teaches you how Lightning Network nodes connect, share information, and send value back-and-forth using channels.

The approach taken revolves around a global understanding of the roles a node must perform. This would normally take a Herculean effort to understand at a programmatic level. We simplify this complexity into discrete states and events taken by the user, our peers, or the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows us to narrow our focus and perform small programming tasks. When we combine everything together, the result is a fully functional Bitcoin Lightning Network node.
