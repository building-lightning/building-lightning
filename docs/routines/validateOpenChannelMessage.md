## Subroutine `validateOpenChannelMessage`

Validate the recevied `open_channel` message as defined in [BOLT 2](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#the-open_channel-message).

Inputs:

-   Received `open_channel` message
-   Node's channel preferences

Calls:

-   `getFeeRatePerKw`

1. Must fail if the the `chain_hash` is unknown
1. Must fail if `funding_satoshis` >= 2^24 and `option_support_large_channel` has not be negotiated
1. May fail if `funding_satoshis` is too small
1. Must fail if `push_msat` > `funding_sats` \* 1000
1. Must fail if `to_self_delay` is unreasonable large. While there is no hard limit, the receiving node should not subject itself to possible denial-of-service attacks. A reasonable value is 1 day to 2 weeks.
1. Must fail if `max_accepted_htlcs` > 483
1. May fail if `max_accepted_htlcs` is too small
1. Must fail if `feerate_per_kw` is too small for timely processing after calling `getFeeRatePerKw` subroutine.
1. Must fail if `feerate_per_kw` is unreasonably large
1. Must fail if funder's amount for the initial commitment is not sufficient for full fee payment
1. May fail if `channel_reserve_balance` is too large
1. Must fail if both `to_local` and `to_remote` are <= `channel_reserve_satoshis`
1. Must fail if `dust_limit_satoshis` > `channel_reserve_balance`
1. Must fail if `dust_limit_satoshis` < 354 satoshis
1. May fail if it considers `dust_limit_satoshis` too large
1. Must fail if `funding_pubkey` is an invalid public key
1. Must fail if `payment_basepoint`, `delayed_payment_basepoint`, `htlc_basepoint`, or `revocation_basepoint` are invalid public keys
1. May fail if `announce_channels` was false, yet wishes to publically announce channels
1. May fail if it considers `htlc_mimium_msat` too large
1. May fail if `max_htlc_value_in_flight_msat` is too small
